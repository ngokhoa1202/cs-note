[k3OS](https://k3os.io/) (the Kubernetes Operating System) is a Linux distribution that aims to minimize the OS maintenance tasks in a Kubernetes cluster. It was designed to work with Rancher's [K3s](https://k3s.io/) lightweight Kubernetes distribution. k3OS installs fast, boots fast, requires no package manager, and is managed through Kubernetes, being optimized to run in a low-resource computing environment by running only necessary services.

# Components
- The k3OS speeds up the K3s cluster boot time. At boot time the k3OS image becomes available to K3s and the cluster takes full control over all the nodes' maintenance, eliminating the need to log in to each individual node for upgrades or other maintenance activities.
- The k3OS speeds up the K3s cluster boot time. At boot time the k3OS image becomes available to K3s and the cluster takes full control over all the nodes' maintenance, eliminating the need to log in to each individual node for upgrades or other maintenance activities.

# Benefits
Key benefits of using k3OS are:

- It is a minimalist OS that eliminates unnecessary libraries and services.
- It decreases complexity and boot time.
- It is highly secure due to a small code base and a decreased attack surface.
- It was designed to integrate with Rancher's K3s Kubernetes distribution.
- Updates and other OS maintenance tasks are performed directly from within the K3s Kubernetes cluster.
- OS configuration is simplified through **cloud-init**.
