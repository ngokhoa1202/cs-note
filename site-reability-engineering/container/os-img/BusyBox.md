# Introduction
[BusyBox](https://busybox.net/), the Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux, combines very small versions of several popular UNIX utilities into a single compact executable. While these utilities incorporate fewer options, they still support the expected functionality and behavior. Written with size-optimization and limited resources in mind, with a container image between 1 MB to 5 MB, BusyBox is able to pack a complete environment making it an ideal fit for small or embedded systems. In addition, its modular nature makes it very easy to customize. 

Although not an Operating System in itself, BusyBox was designed to run on Linux and to enhance a lightweight OS with tools needed to help developers troubleshoot and debug their containerized applications.
