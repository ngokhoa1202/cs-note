# Introduction
Oracle is a leading cloud services provider through its [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) offering. Oracle's IaaS cloud service model is implemented by a wide range of [Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/products.html) products. A commonly used infrastructure product is [Cloud Compute](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/), which includes several options to support various types of I/O intensive workloads, high-performance computing (HPC), and artificial intelligence (AI). These options are represented by Cloud Compute Instances that include Virtual Machines (VMs), Bare Metal Servers, GPU-optimized VMs and Bare Metal Servers, alongside Autonomous Linux instances, and instances optimized for Container Registries and Container Engines for Kubernetes.

[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Virtual Machines](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/virtual-machines.html) are offered in many shapes with Oracle Compute Units (OCPUs) to support a wide range of workloads and software platforms, allowing for storage support customization from remote block storage to high local SSD storage capacity. 

At the core of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure are Bare Metal Servers capable of supporting Nested Virtualization when paired with a hypervisor such as KVM.

Oracle Cloud is also a paid offering; however, similar to several other cloud providers, Oracle also has a [Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/?source=:ow:o:s:po:0917CloudSEEDIF&intcmp=:ow:o:s:po:0917CloudSEEDIF) offering. The free tier is composed of a set of Always Free services, coupled with free credit towards additional eligible infrastructure services, available for a limited time upon signing up. The free tier encourages users to navigate the Oracle Cloud services and to become familiar with its most popular options and features.

# Features
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure VMs offer flexible performance paired with strong isolation thanks to cloud-optimized hardware, software, and networking, all at an advantageous cost. 

Infrastructure VMs are offered in several shapes, which are determined by the virtual hardware profile of the instance:

- Standard, or general-purpose instances, offering a balance between compute, memory, and networking resources, suitable for most common use cases. 
- Dense IO, or high-performance instances, paired with large local non-volatile memory express (NVMe) SSD storage, suitable for large database applications.

When provisioning Cloud VMs, users are able to manage additional instance aspects and related services:  

- Flexible image management by allowing users to choose between images based on enterprise Linux distributions or Windows Server, to bring their own custom guest operating systems, or to choose an image from an Oracle partner
- Low latency block storage for boot volumes, for increased performance and reliability, and to facilitate backups and restores
- Secure and flexible network through fully customizable private Virtual Cloud Networks (VCN)
- High availability by distributing application deployments in multi-regions, multi-availability domains or multi-fault domains, ensuring fault isolation, and low latency across availability domains.
# Benefits
