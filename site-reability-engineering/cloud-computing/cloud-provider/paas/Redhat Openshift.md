# Introduction
[Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) is an open source PaaS solution provided by Red Hat. It is built on top of the container technology orchestrated by [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). OpenShift can be deployed in the cloud as a managed service or as a self-managed deployment on a public or private cloud optimized to run containers and Kubernetes.

Red Hat offers several [products](https://cloud.redhat.com/products) under OpenShift, categorized by their deployment models:

- Red Hat OpenShift - Managed  
    Hosted OpenShift deployments on public cloud platforms managed by Red Hat. This model includes the Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS, Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, and Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift.
- Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus - Self-managed   
    Create your own private, secure, Kubernetes multi-cluster PaaS.
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform - Self-managed  
    Create your own self-managed consistent hybrid cloud PaaS to build and scale containerized applications.
- Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Engine - Self-managedAn entry-level solution promoting the advantages of OpenShift over other Kubernetes solutions, supported by Red Hat.

All the upstream development on OpenShift happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/openshift/origin), and it is tracked under [OKD](https://github.com/openshift/okd) - the Community Distribution of Kubernetes that powers Red Hat OpenShift, referred to as [Origin Kubernetes](https://github.com/openshift/origin) in its earlier releases.

# Features
Red Hat OpenShift allows developers to easily and quickly deploy containerized applications through application images and application templates enabled for one-click application deployments.

Thanks to Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift receives all the features offered by the container orchestration platform, such as adding or removing nodes at runtime, persistent storage, and auto-scaling.

Red Hat OpenShift integrates well with Continuous Deployment tools to deploy applications as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

Applications are managed with ease through command line (CLI) tools, web user interface (UI), and integrated development environment (IDE) available for Red Hat OpenShift.
