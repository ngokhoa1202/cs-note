# Private cloud
- Also known as on-premise.
- It is designated and operated <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">solely for one organization</mark>. It can be hosted <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">internally or externally</mark> and managed by internal teams or a third party. 
- A private cloud can be built using a software stack like [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/)
# Public cloud
- It is open to the public and anybody can use it, after swiping a credit card, of course. 
- Examples: Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean.
# Hybrid cloud
- Public and private clouds can be bound together to offer a hybrid cloud. Such hybrid clouds are beneficial for:
	- Storage of sensitive information on the private cloud, while offering public services based on that information from a public cloud.
	- Meeting temporary resources needs during peak or times of high demand by scaling to the cloud, known as bursting, when such temporary needs of additional computing resources cannot be met by the private cloud.

# Additional cloud deployment models
- _Community Cloud_  
    Formed by multiple organizations sharing a common cloud infrastructure.
- _Distributed Cloud_  
    Formed by distributed systems connected by a single network.
- _Multicloud_  
    One organization uses multiple public cloud providers to run its workload, typically to avoid vendor lock-in.
- _Poly Cloud_  
    One organization uses multiple public cloud providers to leverage specific services from each provider.
