# Definition
- WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing a <mark class="hltr-yellow">simultaneous bi-directional</mark> communication channel *over a single TCP connection*.
# Architecture
- The base WebSocket protocol consists of an opening <mark class="hltr-yellow">handshake</mark> (upgrading the connection from HTTP to WebSockets), followed by data transfer.
- After the client and server successfully negotiate the opening handshake, the WebSocket connection acts as a <mark class="hltr-yellow">persistent full-duplex</mark> communication channel where each side can, independently, send data at will. 
- Clients and servers transfer messages back and forth , which, can consist of one or more frames. Once the WebSocket connection has served its purpose, it can be terminated via a <mark class="hltr-yellow">closing handshake</mark>.

## Opening handshake
- The client issues a WebSocket handshake request, which is just a specially formatted HTTP GET request. The server, if it supports the WebSocket protocol and is willing to establish a connection with the client, responds with a WebSocket handshake response.
- The server must returns an `HTTP 101 Switching Protocol` response for the connection to be successfully established; otherwise, the handshake failed and the connection is not established.
### Client handshake request
- A WebSocket handshake request is a specially formatted HTTP GET request
```HTTP title='Client handshake request format'
GET /chat HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com:8000
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
```
- The request includes the following headers:
	- `Upgrade: websocket` - indicates that the client wants to upgrade the connection to use the WebSocket protocol.
	- `Connection: Upgrade` - tells proxies or other intermediaries to also upgrade the connection.
	- `Sec-WebSocket-Key` - a Base64-encoded random value that helps the server prove it’s a WebSocket-capable server.
	- `Sec-WebSocket-Version` - the version of the WebSocket protocol the client wishes to use.
- In addition to these mandatory headers, the client might also include:
	- `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` - a list of sub-protocols that the client wishes to speak, ordered by preference.
	- `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` - a list of extensions the client wishes to use.
### Server handshake response
- If the server understands the WebSocket protocol and accepts the request to upgrade, it sends back a HTTP response
```HTTP title='Server handshake response format'
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
```
- The response includes:
	- `HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols` - indicates the successful upgrade from HTTP to WebSocket.
	- `Upgrade: websocket` - confirms the protocol upgrade.
	- `Connection: Upgrade` - indicates that the connection has been upgraded.
	- `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` - a value calculated from the client’s Sec-WebSocket-Key, which helps verify that the server understood the WebSocket handshake request.
- If the client requested a sub-protocol, the server includes the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header with the name of the chosen sub-protocol. If the client requested extensions, the server may include the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header with the extensions it has agreed to use.
## Data framing
- Once the WebSocket connection is established, the client and server can send WebSocket **data frames** back and forth in either direction. Each message consists of one or more frames. There are different types of frames:
	- Text frames - contain UTF-8 encoded text data.
	- Binary frames - contain binary data.
	- Control frames - used for protocol-level signaling, such as pings, pongs, and close frames.
### Frame structure
- The base framing protocol breaks down a frame into the following components:
	-  `FIN` bit - indicates whether this is the final fragment in a message (1) or not (0).
	- `RSV1`, `RSV2`, `RSV3` bits - reserved for extensions; must be 0 unless an extension is negotiated.
	- `Opcode` (4 bits) - indicates the type of frame:
	    - `0x0`: continuation frame
	    - `0x1`: text frame
	    - `0x2`: binary frame
	    - `0x8`: connection close
	    - `0x9`: ping
	    - `0xA`: pong
	- `MASK` bit - indicates whether the payload data is masked (1) or not (0).
	- `Payload length` - the length of the payload data.
	- `Masking key` (optional, 32 bits) - included only if the MASK bit is set to 1.
	- `Payload data` - the actual data.
### Message fragmentation
- WebSocket messages can be split into multiple frames, which can be useful for sending large messages without having to buffer the entire message on the sender’s side. When a message is fragmented:
    - The first frame has an opcode indicating the message type (text or binary).
    - Following frames have an opcode of 0 (continuation frame).
    - The final frame has the FIN bit set to 1.
## Control frames
- Control frames are used for **protocol-level signaling** within the WebSocket connection. They are always un-fragmented (FIN bit set to 1) and have a maximum payload length of 125 bytes.~
### Ping-pong frames
- Ping (opcode `0x9`) and Pong (opcode `0xA`) frames are used for checking that the connection is still **alive** or for measuring latency. When a peer receives a Ping frame, it must send back a Pong frame with the same payload as soon as possible.
### Close frames
- Close frames (opcode `0x8`) are used to initiate the closing handshake, which indicates the beginning of the process to terminate the WebSocket connection.
- A close frame may contain a status code and a reason for closing in its payload. The status code is a 16-bit unsigned integer. Refers to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CloseEvent/code
## Closing handshake
- The closing handshake is initiated when either the client or server sends a close frame. The peer that receives the close frame should send back another close frame in response.
- After sending a close frame, the peer should not send any more data frames. 
- After both sides have exchanged close frames, the TCP connection is closed.
# Protocol extensions

# Sub-protocols
- Subprotocols define the high-level semantics of the communication over WebSockets. They are application-specific protocols layered on top of WebSockets. Common subprotocols include:
	- *MQTT over WebSockets* - for IoT and messaging applications.
	- *STOMP over WebSockets* - for messaging applications.
	- *JSON-RPC over WebSockets* - for remote procedure calls.
