# Web architecture
- The web is a layered architecture from client to network infrastructure:
	- Client Layer (The Web):
		- HTML: Document structure and content
		- CSS: Styling and presentation
		- Javascript: Client-side logic and interactivity
		- Web APIs: Browser interfaces (DOM, Fetch, etc.)
	- Application Layer:
		- HTTP: Application protocol for web communication
		- DNS: Domain name resolution to IP addresses
		- TLS: Encryption layer securing HTTP (HTTPS)
	- Transport/Network Layer:
		- TCP: Reliable, connection-oriented data transmission
		- UDP: Fast, connectionless transmission (used by DNS)
		- IP: Packet routing across networks
