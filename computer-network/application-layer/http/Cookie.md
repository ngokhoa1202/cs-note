- HTTP is stateless, but cookie helps ==maintain client's state==.
# Components
4 components:
- Cookie header in HTTP response.
- Cookie header in next HTTP request.
- Cookie file kept on ==client side==.
- Back-end processing: create entry in server.

# Security
- client side keeps ==cookie unique by an id== generated by server side.
- Security concerns: 3rd party allowed to track cookie and browsing history?

# Usage
## Session authentication
- Upon sign-in, the server uses the `Set-Cookie` HTTP header in the response to set a cookie with a unique <mark class="hltr-yellow">session identifier</mark>.
- On subsequent requests to the same domain, the browser sends the cookie over the net using the `Cookie` HTTP header.
-  Extracting the `Cookie` header of the request, the server knows who made the request.
