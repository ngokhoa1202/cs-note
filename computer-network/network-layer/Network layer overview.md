- "==Best-effort==" service.
- Network ==core== $\Rightarrow$ mainly works with ==router==.
- Provide service:
	- Routing.
	- Forwarding.
- Packet is called ==datagram==.
# Data plane
- [Data plane overview](Data%20plane%20overview.md)
- Forwarding: move packet to ==correct link interface==.
# Control plane
- Routing: determine packet's route.
