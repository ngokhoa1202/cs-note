# Structured programming
- Modules can be ==recursively composed into provable units==.
- Imposes direct transfer of control (like `goto`).
# Object-oriented programming
- Imposes ==indirect transfer control== (like pointer to function).
- Master dependency inversion.
- ![](Pasted%20image%2020240615193301.png)
- Naturally reflects a model in [Domain driven design](software-engineering/software-architecture/domain-driven-design/Domain%20driven%20design.md)
# Functional programming
- Focuses state immutability to preven race condition or deadlock.
- Imposes variable assignment.
- Event sourcing.
