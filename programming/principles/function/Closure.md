# Closure
- A closure is an environment which encapsulates a function with references to variables from its surrounding lexical scope. When a function is created, it <mark class="hltr-yellow">retains access to variables</mark> from its enclosing scope even after that scope has finished executing
- The scope object and all its local variables are tied to the function and will persist as long as that function persists.
- Languages which support closure will help <mark class="hltr-yellow">keep a reference to a scope</mark> (including its parent scopes), even after the block in which those variables were declared has finished executing.
```Javascript title='Closure in Javascript example'
outer = function() {
  var a = 1;
  var inner = function() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  return inner; // this returns a function
}

var fnc = outer(); // execute outer to get inner 
fnc();
```
