# Assignment to hardware
- An assignment of a built-in type is a <mark class="hltr-yellow">simple machine copy operation</mark>.
```cpp title='Assignment to memory example'
int x = 2;
int y = 3;
x = y;
```

- Different variables can refer to the same value in memory using either pointer or reference. (See [Alias, dangling references and garbage](Alias,%20dangling%20references%20and%20garbage.md))
```cpp title='Pointer example'
int x = 2;
int y = 3;
int* p = &x;
intâˆ— q = &y;
p = q;
```

```cpp title='Reference example'
int x = 2;
int y = 3;
int& r = x; // r refers to x
int& r2 = y; // r2 refers to y
r = r2; // read through r2, write through r: x becomes 3
```
