# State hooks
- *State* hooks allow a component to store application information.
- [[useState hook]]
# Context hooks
- _Context_ hooks allow a component to receive information from distant parents without passing it as props.
- [[useContext hook]]
# Reference hooks
- _Refs_ let a component store some information that isnâ€™t used for rendering, such as a DOM node.
- Being distinct from state, updating a ref does not re-render components.
- Ref hooks are employed to work with built-in browser API.
- [[useRef hook]]
# Effect hooks
- _Effects_ let a component connect to and synchronize with external systems such as network, browser DOM, animations and widgets from other UI libraries.
- [[useEffect hook]]
- [[useLayoutEffect hook]]
- [[useInsertionEffect hook]]
# Performance hooks
- Performance hooks optimize application performance by caching heavy calculations or skipping re-render.
- [[useMemo hook]]
- [[useCallback hook]]
- [[useTransition hook]]
- [[useDeferredValue hook]]
