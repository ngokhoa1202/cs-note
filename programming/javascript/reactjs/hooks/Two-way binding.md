# Controlled form inputs
- Employ `useState` hook to bind form content to user input [Callback to update state](useState%20hook.md#Callback%20to%20update%20state).
```jsx
<input value={someValue} onChange={handleChange} />
...
```
- Make use of ==event handler callback== to change state.
# Uncontrolled form inputs
- Employe `useRef` hook to manipulate DOM node [Manipulating DOM tree](useRef%20hook.md#Manipulating%20DOM%20tree)
- Similar to HTML.
