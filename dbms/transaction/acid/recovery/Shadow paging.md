- Based on [Shadow update](Recovery%20concepts.md#Shadow%20update) $\implies$ AFIM does not overwrite its BFIM but is stored at another location on disk.
# Shadow paging
- There are two directories:
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Current directory</mark> contains the entry points to database pages on disk used and modified during transaction execution.
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Shadow directory</mark> the most recent or current entry points to database pages on disk that <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">are never modified</mark>.
- When a write_item operation is performed, a <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">new copy</mark> of the modified database page is <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">created</mark>, but the <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">old copy</mark> of that page is <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">not overwritten</mark>.
- For pages updated by the transaction, two versions are kept. The old version is referenced by the shadow directory and the new version by the current directory.

# Implication
- Complex storage management.
- Requires garbage collection.
- Atomic migration between current and shadow directories.
