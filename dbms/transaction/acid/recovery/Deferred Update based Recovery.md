# Deferred Update based Recovery
## Rules
- A transaction cannot change the database on disk until it reaches its commit point. $\implies$ all data items having been changed by that transaction must be <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">pinned</mark> before the commit point.
- A transaction reaches its commit point only after all its <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">REDO-type log</mark> records haven been written in the log and the log buffer is force written to the disk.
## Implications
- Only affected transactions which were recorded in the log a<mark style="background: #e4e62d;">fter the last checkpoin</mark>t were redone in case of system crash.
- Requires two tables:
	- Active table: for only active table at the time of system crash <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">since the last checkpoint</mark>. $\implies$ ignore.
	- Commit table: for transactions having committed at the time of system crash<mark style="background: #e4e62d;"> since the last checkpoint</mark>. $\implies$ redo.
# Examples
- ![](Pasted%20image%2020241214122048.png)

- Transaction 1 and transaction 4 committed after the checkpoint so they are redone. Transaction 2 and transaction 4 did not commit so they are ignored.![](Pasted%20image%2020241214122753.png)
