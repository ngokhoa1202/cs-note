# Timestamp
- A timestamp is a <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">unique identifier</mark> managed by DBMS to identify a transaction.
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">Monotonically increasing</mark>, equivalent to a transaction start time $\implies$ The smaller timestamp is, the older transaction is.
- Denoted by $\text{TS}(T)$.
## Read timestamp
- Denoted by $\text{read\_TS}(X)$.
- The <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">largest</mark> timestamp among all the timestamps of transactions having successfully read X.
## Write timestamp
- Denoted by $\text{write\_TS}(X)$.
- The <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">largest</mark> timestamp among all the timestamps of transactions having successfully written X.
# Timestamp ordering algorithm
## Basic timestamp ordering algorithm
### Rules
- When a transaction $T$ issues a $\text{write\_item(X)}$ operation:
	- If $\text{read\_TS}(X) > \text{TS}(T)$ or $\text{write\_TS}(X) > \text{TS}(T)$, then abort and rollback $T$ with a new timestamp and reject the operation.
		- Because a younger transaction $T'$ have read or written item $X$.
	- Otherwise, execute $\text{write\_item(X)}$ within $T$ and set $\text{write\_TS}(X) = \text{TS}(T)$
- When a transaction $T$ issues a $\text{read\_item(X)}$ operation:
	- If  $\text{write\_TS}(X) > \text{TS}(T)$, then abort and rollback $T$ with a new timestamp and reject the operation.
		- Because a younger transaction $T'$ have written item $X$.
	- Otherwise,  execute $\text{read\_item(X)}$ within $T$ and set $\text{read\_TS}(X) = \text{max}\{\text{TS}(T),\space \text{read\_TS}(X)\}$
> [!Important]
> If there exists an active younger transaction that has mutated the data item before that item is required to access by the current transaction, then the current transaction is aborted and rolled back.


### Implications
- The schedules produced by Basic TO are <mark class="hltr-yellow">serializable</mark> and <mark class="hltr-yellow">deadlock-free</mark>.
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">Cyclic restar</mark>t and <mark class="hltr-yellow">starvation</mark> still occurs if a transaction is continually aborted and restarted.
### Examples
- ![](Pasted%20image%2020241211164855.png)
-  When $T_2$ issues $w_2(C)$ operation, $RT_C = 175 > \text{TS}(T_2) = 150$ which means there is a younger transaction, which is $T_3$, having read item $C$. As a result, transaction $T_2$ is aborted.
## Strict timestamp ordering algorithm
### Rules
- When a transaction $T$ issues a $\text{write\_item(X)}$ operation:
	- If $\text{read\_TS}(X) > \text{TS}(T)$ or $\text{write\_TS}(X) > \text{TS}(T)$, then delay transaction $T$ until the transaction $T'$ which have written $X$ terminates.
		- Because a younger transaction $T'$ have read or written item $X$.
	- Otherwise, execute $\text{write\_item(X)}$ within $T$ and set $\text{write\_TS}(X) = \text{TS}(T)$
- When a transaction $T$ issues a $\text{read\_item(X)}$ operation:
	- If  $\text{write\_TS}(X) > \text{TS}(T)$, then delay transaction $T$ until the transaction $T'$ which have written $X$ terminates.
		- Because a younger transaction $T'$ have written item $X$.
	- Otherwise,  execute $\text{read\_item(X)}$ within $T$ and set $\text{read\_TS}(X) = \text{max}\{\text{TS}(T),\space \text{read\_TS}(X)\}$
>[!Important]
>Similarly to Basic timestamp ordering algorithm, the transaction which is about to access the data item that has been mutated by another active transaction, however, suspends its execution until the later transaction terminates.


### Implications
- The schedules produced by Strict TO are serializable, deadlock-free in terms of serializability and strict in terms of recoverability.
- Cyclic restart and starvation do not occur because the younger transaction $T'$ is not aborted but waits for the older transaction $T$ to terminate.
- Longer transactions.
## Thomas's write rule
### Rules
- When a transaction $T$ issues a $\text{write\_item(X)}$ operation:
	- If $\text{read\_TS}(X) > \text{TS}(T)$, then abort and rollback transaction $T$ with a new timestamp and reject the operation.
		- Because a younger transaction $T'$ has written item $X$. 
	- If $\text{write\_TS}(X) > \text{TS}(T)$, <mark class="hltr-yellow">ignore the write operation and continue execution</mark>. 
		- Because the write operation is already outdated and obsolete.
- When a transaction $T$ issues a $\text{read\_item(X)}$ operation:
	- If  $\text{write\_TS}(X) > \text{TS}(T)$, then abort and rollback $T$ with a new timestamp and reject the operation.
		- Because a younger transaction $T'$ has written item $X$.
	- Otherwise,  execute $\text{read\_item(X)}$ within $T$ and set $\text{read\_TS}(X) = \text{max}\{\text{TS}(T),\space \text{read\_TS}(X)\}$
### Implications
- The schedules produced by Thomas's write rule are not guaranteed to be serializable.
- The rejection of write operations is fewer and hence boosts transaction's performance.
