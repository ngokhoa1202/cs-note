- Also known as Validation (or Certification) concurrency control techniques.
- Acronym is OCC.
# Validation-based concurrency control
- Transaction serializability is checked only when transactions prepare to commit. $\implies$ optimistically.
- OCC has three phases.
## Read phase
- A transaction can read values of committed data items.
- However, updates are applied <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">only to local copies</mark> (versions) of the data items (in database cache).
## Validation phase
- Serializability is checked before transactions permanently write their updates to the database.
- This phase for $T_i$ checks that, for each transaction $T_j$ that is either committed or is in its validation phase, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">one of </mark>the following conditions holds (check from top to bottom):
	- $T_j$ completes its write phase before $T_i$ starts its read phase.
	- $T_i$ starts its write phase after $T_j$ completes its write phase, and the read_set of $T_i$ has no items in common with the write_set of $T_j$. 
	- $T_j$ completes its read phase before $T_i$ completes its read phase, and both the read_set and write_set of $T_i$ have no items in common with the write_set of $T_j$, 
- If none of the three conditions hold, $T_i$ is likely to interfere $T_j$ and therefore, $T_i$ is aborted.
## Write phase
- On a successful validation transactions’ updates are applied to the database; otherwise, transactions are restarted.
