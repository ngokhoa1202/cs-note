- Denoted by $\pi_{a_1,a_2,...,a_n}(R)$
# Algorithm for PROJECT operation
- If attribute list has a key of relation R, retrieve <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">all</mark> tuples from $R$.
- If attribute list does not include a key attribute, remove duplicates.
# Algorithm for SET operations
## Union operations
- Sort the two relations on the same attributes.
- Scan and merge both sorted files concurrently, whenever the same tuple exists in both relations, <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">only one</mark> is kept in the merged results.

## Intersection
- Sort the two relations on the same attributes.
- Scan and merge both sorted files concurrently, keep in the merged results only those tuples that appear in <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">both relations</mark>.

## Set difference
- Sort the two relations on the same attributes.
- Keep in the merged results only those tuples that appear in relation $R$ but not in relation $S$.
