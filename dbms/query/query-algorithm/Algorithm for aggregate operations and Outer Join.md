# Algorithm for aggregate operations
## Algorithm for min-max operation
- Example `SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee`
- If an (ascending) <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">B+ index</mark> on SALARY exists for the employee relation, then the index could be traversed for the largest value, which would entail following the <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">right most pointer</mark> in each index node from the root to a leaf.
## Algorithm for sum, count, average operation
- If a <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">dense index</mark> exists, the associated computation can be applied to the values in the index.
- In case of a non-dense index, the actual number of records associated with each index entry must be accounted for. 
- With GROUP BY, sorting or hashing on the group attributes is used to partition the file into groups; then aggregate function is computed in each group.
	- In case a clustering index exists in the grouping attributes, the file is already partitioned.
