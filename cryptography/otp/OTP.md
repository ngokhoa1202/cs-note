- Stands for ==One-time Pad==, also called ==Vernam cipher==.

# Ideal OTP
## Definition
- A stream cipher satisfying:
	- key stream $s_0, s_1, s_2,...$ generated by [True Random Numer Generators - TRNG](PRNG.md#True%20Random%20Numer%20Generators%20-%20TRNG)
	- Only ==legitimate parties== know the key stream.
	- Each ==bit== of key stream $s_i$ ==used once==.
## Security
- ==Unconditinally secure==.
- Impractical due to key stream generation for each use.
# Practical OTP
- ![](Pasted%20image%2020240526085516.png)
- Emulates Ideal OTP:
	- Two sides exchange a secret key $k$.
	- Cannot employ truly [True Random Numer Generators - TRNG](PRNG.md#True%20Random%20Numer%20Generators%20-%20TRNG)
	- Uses ==deterministic generator== instead.
## Security
- Computationlly secure.
