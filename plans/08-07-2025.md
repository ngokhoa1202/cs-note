  2. Leave Management Service

  Quarkus + reactive programming
  - Why: High-frequency operations, complex calculations, clear boundaries
  - Features: Leave applications, balance tracking, holiday integration
  - Tech Stack: Quarkus, Hibernate Reactive, Redis caching
  - Benefits: Fast startup, low memory footprint for high-volume requests

  3. Workflow Engine Service

  Spring Boot + Spring State Machine
  - Why: Reusable across all approval processes, complex state logic
  - Features: Step-based approvals, role resolution, state transitions
  - Tech Stack: Spring Boot, Spring State Machine, PostgreSQL
  - Integration: Event-driven communication with business services

  üî• High-Impact Supporting Services

  4. Master Data Service

  Quarkus + GraalVM native
  - Why: Reference data, read-heavy, perfect for native compilation
  - Features: Geographic data, organizational structure, holidays
  - Tech Stack: Quarkus native, PostgreSQL, Redis caching
  - Benefits: Ultra-fast startup, low memory usage

  5. Notification Service

  Spring Boot + WebSocket + RabbitMQ
  - Why: Real-time updates, event-driven, cross-service communication
  - Features: WebSocket management, multi-channel notifications
  - Tech Stack: Spring Boot, Spring WebSocket, RabbitMQ, Redis

  6. User Profile Service

  Spring Boot + Spring Security
  - Why: Core authentication, session management, permission caching
  - Features: User authentication, role-based access, session management
  - Tech Stack: Spring Boot, Spring Security, Redis, PostgreSQL

  üìã Implementation Roadmap

  Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 months)

  1. API Gateway - Spring Cloud Gateway with load balancing
  2. Master Data Service - Quarkus native for reference data
  3. User Profile Service - Spring Security with JWT/OAuth2

  Phase 2: Core Business (3-4 months)

  4. Workflow Engine Service - Spring State Machine for approvals
  5. Business Trip Service - Full domain extraction with events
  6. Notification Service - Real-time updates and messaging

  Phase 3: Expansion (2-3 months)

  7. Leave Management Service - Similar patterns to business trip
  8. Maternity Leave Service - Specialized compliance features

  üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

  Spring Boot Services

  - Complex business logic (Business Trip, Workflow Engine)
  - Rich ecosystem for enterprise patterns
  - Excellent Spring Security integration
  - Spring Cloud for distributed systems

  Quarkus Services

  - High-performance, low-latency (Master Data, Leave Management)
  - Native compilation for fast startup
  - Reactive programming for high throughput
  - Excellent for cloud-native deployments

  Event-Driven Communication

  - Apache Kafka for workflow state changes
  - RabbitMQ for real-time notifications
  - Redis for caching and session management
  - PostgreSQL for transactional data

  üí° Why These Are Most Viable

  1. Clear Business Boundaries - Each service owns a complete domain
  2. Minimal Cross-Dependencies - Can be developed independently
  3. High Business Value - Core HR processes with immediate impact
  4. Scalability Benefits - Different scaling requirements per service
  5. Technology Fit - Java ecosystem aligns well with existing patterns

  Start with Business Trip Service - it's the perfect candidate with clear boundaries, complex workflows, and high
  value. The existing Vietnamese business logic and approval patterns translate well to Spring Boot's enterprise
  features.
