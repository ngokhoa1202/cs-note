- In a push protocol, the server or sender initiates the communication and pushes data to the client or receiver without the client requesting it.  
- The server actively sends data to the client ==whenever new data is availabl==e or whenever an event occurs.  
- Push protocols are commonly used in real-time communication systems, such as instant messaging, notifications, and live streaming services.  
- Examples: WebSockets, MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), and Apple Push Notification Service (APNs).
- $\Longrightarrow$ ==the server sending data to the client proactively== without client's request.

# Pull protocol
- In a pull protocol, the client or receiver initiates the communication by requesting data from the server or sender.  
- The client periodically requests data from the server check for updates.
- Pull protocols are commonly used in scenarios where clients need to retrieve data on their own schedule, such as email clients checking for new emails or web browsers fetching web pages.  
- Examples: HTTP, FTP, and POP3.
- $\Longrightarrow$ ==client requesting data from the server as needed==.
