- Stands for ==Frequence Division Multiple Access.==

# Principle
- Divides spectrum into ==frequency bands==.
- Each station has its ==fixed frequency band==.

# Advantage
- Fair, each node is allocated throughput $\frac{R}{N} \space bps$ 
- Decentralized.
- Simple.
# Disadvantage
- Allocation is unchanged $\Rightarrow$ ==each node's throughput is unchanged==, even if there is only one node wanting to send while there are ==many idle slots==.
