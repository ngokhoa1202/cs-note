# Router architecture
- Three main components:
	- ==Routing processor==: network-specialized computer, executes algorithm.
	- ==Switch fabric==: connects inbound port to outbound ports.
	- Ports: router interface
		- Inbound port.
		- Outbound port.
	- (Bus): connect CPU to memory (like computer).

# Input port processing
- Router employs ==forwarding table== to look up for outbound ports.

### Destination-based forwarding
- Employs ==longest prefix matching==.
- In practice, use ==TCAM== device (Ternary Content Addressable Memories).
