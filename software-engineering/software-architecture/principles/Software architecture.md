# Definition
- *Architecture is the <mark class="hltr-yellow">fundamental organization</mark> of a system, embodied in its <mark class="hltr-yellow">components</mark>, their <mark class="hltr-yellow">relationships</mark> to each other and the <mark class="hltr-yellow">environment</mark>, and the principles governing its design and evolution*.
# Software architecture vs software design
## Software architecture
- **Architecture characteristics** encompass the quality attributes and non-functional requirements that shape the system, such as scalability, performance, security, and maintainability.... These characteristics <mark class="hltr-yellow">drive fundamental design decisions</mark> and establish constraints that influence the entire system.
- **Architectural style** refers to the <mark class="hltr-yellow">overarching patterns and approaches used to organize</mark> the system, such as microservices, monolithic, event-driven, or layered architectures. This choice fundamentally affects how components interact and how the system evolves over time.
- **Component structure** defines the major building blocks of the system and their relationships. At this level, architects determine how to <mark class="hltr-yellow">decompose the system into manageable components</mark>, establish boundaries between components, and define interfaces for communication.

## Software design
- Software design, in contrast, addresses the detailed implementation concerns that <mark class="hltr-yellow">translate architectural decisions into working software</mark>.
- **Class design** involves creating the detailed object-oriented structures, defining specific classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships. This is where design patterns are applied and the internal structure of components takes shape.
- **User interface** development focuses on the presentation layer, determining how users interact with the system through screens, forms, and navigation flows.
- **Source code** represents the actual implementation, where all architectural and design decisions materialize into executable programs written in specific programming languages.

## Knowledge triangle
- ![](Pasted%20image%2020250219123418.png)
- Technical breadth vs technical depth.

## Trade-off
- *There is no right or wrong answers in software architecture - <mark class="hltr-yellow">only trade-offs</mark>.* 
- Architecture is the stuff you can Google, it depends on the <mark class="hltr-yellow">business context</mark>.
