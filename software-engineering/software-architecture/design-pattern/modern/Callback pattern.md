- A callback, also known as a "call-after" function, is _any executable code that is passed as an argument to other code_; that other code is expected to call back (execute) the argument at a given time.
- A callback is a high-order function.

# Purpose

- Maintain the correct order of execution of asynchronous operations.

# Application

- Handling non-blocking operations, such as reading files, making HTTP requests, or querying a database.
- Event handling in user interfaces, for example, responding to user actions like clicks or key presses.
- Decoupling modules or components that need to interact without having a direct dependency on each other.

# Components
## Caller
- The function that takes the callback as an argument and invokes it at the appropriate time.
## Callback
- The function that is passed as an argument to the caller and is executed when the caller decides.
## Context
- The scope in which the callback function is executed, which can affect its behavior and access to variables.
## Error handler
- Another callback function used to handle if there is any error.

# Example
- ![](Pasted%20image%2020250227075559.png)
- `interface Callback` is the common interface for callback function.
```Java title='interface Callback'

package com.iluwatar.callback;

/**
 * Callback interface.
 */
public interface Callback {

  void call();
}

```

- `class Task` is both the abstract caller and callee delegating `execute` action to its children and will execute the callback when the task is finished.
```Java title='Super class to maintain the execution order of callbacks'
public abstract class Task {

    final void executeWith(Callback callback) {
        execute();
        Optional.ofNullable(callback).ifPresent(Callback::call);
    }

    public abstract void execute();
}
```
- `class SimpleTask` is the concrete caller and callee implementing `execute` action on its own.
```Java title='Concrete caller and callee'
@Slf4j
public final class SimpleTask extends Task {

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        LOGGER.info("Perform some important activity and after call the callback method.");
    }
}
```

- `class Main` is the Client in which a task is executed with its callback.
```Java title='Context class'
@Slf4j
public final class App {

  private App() {
  }

  /**
   * Program entry point.
   */
  public static void main(final String[] args) {
    var task = new SimpleTask();
    task.executeWith(() -> LOGGER.info("I'm done now."));
  }
}
```
# Real example
- Javascript callback & NodeJs.
- `Promise` API in Javascript.
- `Stream` API from Java 8.
# Benefits
- Facilitates asynchronous operations and reactive programming.
- Decouples the execution login from the task of signaling and notification.
# Trade-offs
- Callback hell or pyramid of doom.
