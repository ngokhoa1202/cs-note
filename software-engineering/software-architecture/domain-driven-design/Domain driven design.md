# Purpose
- DDD plays as an <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">ubiquitous language</mark> - shared knowledge between development teams and business experts.

# Documents
- UML diagram represents the <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">overall architecture</mark>, but not the meaning of concepts and what they are meant to do $\implies$ reflects <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">skeletons</mark> of ideas $\implies$ should be kept minimal.
- The technical details about the design is captured in the <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">code</mark>.
# Model-to-implementation mapping
- Model analysis and model design should not be deadly divided, which can lead to that their future activities will not feed into each other.
- Design a portion of the software system to <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">reflect the domain model</mark> in a very literal way. 
- Revisit the model and modify it to be implemented more naturally in software. 
- A modeling paradigm, such as object-oriented paradigm, is used to <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">perform a model-to-implementation mapping</mark>

## OOP paradigm
- OOP is powerful because it is <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">based on a modeling paradigm </mark>and provides implementations of the model constructs. 
- The real breakthrough of object design comes when the code itself <mark style="background: #e4e62d;">expresses the concepts of a model</mark>.

# Advantages
- Software is always in alignment with business goals.
- High scalability.
- High modularity.
- High code quality.
- Facilitate complex business systems.
# Disadvantages
- High initial investment $\implies$ only appropriate for complex systems.
