- Field is subset of [Group](algebra/abstract-algebra/Group.md)
# Definition
- A field $F$ is a group with:
	- Additive group $(F,+)$ with - neutral element $0$.
	- Multiplicative group $(F, \times)$ except $0$, with neutral element $1$.
	- Distributive $$\forall a,b,c \in F: a \times(b+c)=a \times b + a \times c$$
# Finite field
- The number of elements is called ==order== of fields.
## Necessary condition
- Finite field with order $m$ exists if $m=p^n$, where $p$ is prime.
