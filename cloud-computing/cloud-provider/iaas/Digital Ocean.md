[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) is a leading cloud services provider, aiming its cloud platform at both individual users and enterprises. DigitalOcean helps you create a simple cloud quickly, as it promises IaaS virtual instances set up within seconds. DigitalOcean cloud services enable application deployments and scaling on a cloud infrastructure available worldwide, leveraging network and storage flexibility together with security and monitoring tools.

In the DigitalOcean ecosystem, the virtual compute instances are [droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/), and they are Linux-based VMs launched on top of the KVM type-1 hypervisor, with SSD (Solid-State Drive) as their primary storage disk.

DigitalOcean offers paid cloud services, but users can take advantage of a [short-term credit](https://try.digitalocean.com/freetrialoffer/) towards cloud services, part of a free tier offering aimed to encourage users to explore and become familiar with its offerings.

# Feature
DigitalOcean Droplets are easy to configure, users being able to manage the resource profile, guest Operating System, application server, security, backup, monitoring, and more.  

Resource profiles are directly associated with DigitalOcean cost plans and are categorized in Shared CPU and Dedicated CPU plans.

The Shared CPU plan includes the Basic Droplets with burstable vCPU and memory that can be configured to support the running of web servers, forums, and blogs.

The Dedicated CPU plan includes dedicated vCPUs and a specific amount of memory per each vCPU that further determines the Droplet type:

- General Purpose with 4GB of memory for each vCPU, to support high traffic web servers, e-commerce, and SaaS.
- CPU-Optimized with 2GB of memory for each vCPU, to support Machine Learning, CI/CD, and video encoding.
- Memory-Optimized with 8GB of memory for each vCPU to support high-performance DBs, and real-time big data processing.
- Storage-Optimized with NVMe SSD supporting extra large databases and data warehouses.

The Droplet guest OS can be picked from a list of Linux distribution images, such as CentOS, CoreOS, Debian, Fedora, FreeBSD, and Ubuntu. While custom images can be built and used, Droplets can be pre-configured to run [applications](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/) such as Docker, LAMP, MongoDB, MySQL, and Node.js.

Users can take advantage of additional configurable services and features:

- Monitoring to collect performance metrics.
- Cloud Firewalls to secure the network infrastructure.
- Backups that can be automated, allowing for easy Droplet restores or to launch new pre-configured Droplets.
- Snapshots to be used as restore points after a failed upgrade or configuration change.
- Team Management for collaboration. 
- Block Storage for Droplet storage.
- Spaces for scalable and secure storage solutions aimed to store and deliver data.
- Load Balancers for traffic distribution.
- Floating IPs for flexibility when assigning IPs to Droplets and to release them when no longer needed.
- APIs for programmatic Droplet launching.
- Networking features, such as DNS, IPv6, Private networking.
