# Evaluation of Your Current Backend Skills

Your notes demonstrate a highly organized and structured approach to learning, which is a significant strength for any engineering role.

**Strengths:**

*   **Solid Theoretical Foundation in Key Areas:**
    *   **HTTP:** Your notes on HTTP are comprehensive, covering the protocol in depth, including methods, status codes, and the differences between persistent and non-persistent connections. This is a strong asset for any backend developer.
    *   **Design Patterns:** The detailed note on the Singleton pattern, including various implementation strategies and its pros and cons, indicates a deep and nuanced understanding of software design principles.
    *   **SQL and Database Design:** Your notes on SQL DDL show a good understanding of database schema design and constraints.
    *   **Containerization Concepts:** You have a good high-level grasp of Docker's architecture, which is fundamental for modern backend development and SRE.

*   **Excellent Organizational Skills:** The logical structure of your notes, with clear categories and sub-categories, is impressive. This suggests a methodical and organized mindset, which is invaluable in software engineering.

**Areas for Development:**

*   **Fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms:** Your notes on core data structures like hash tables are not yet filled out. A strong command of these fundamentals is non-negotiable for a software engineer.
*   **Operating Systems Concepts:** The note on Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is also a placeholder. A deeper understanding of OS concepts is crucial for writing high-performance, reliable backend services.
*   **Practical Application:** While your theoretical notes are strong, there is less evidence of practical application. The most effective way to solidify your knowledge is to build projects.
*   **Go Language Proficiency:** Your notes suggest you are in the early stages of learning Go. To become a proficient backend developer, you will need to move from theoretical knowledge to practical application.

### 3-Year Roadmap to a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Role

SRE is a discipline that combines software engineering and systems administration. Here is a year-by-year guide to help you transition from your current state to an SRE role.

**Year 1: Master Backend Fundamentals and Begin SRE Exploration**

*   **Fill Core Knowledge Gaps:**
    *   **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Make this your top priority. Work through a comprehensive course and implement all major data structures and algorithms in Go or Python.
    *   **Operating Systems:** Fill in your notes on IPC, memory management, filesystems, and networking.
*   **Gain Practical Experience:**
    *   **Build a Backend Application:** Create a web service from scratch. This should include a REST or gRPC API, a database, and authentication. This is the most critical step to take.
    *   **Embrace the Command Line:** Become proficient in shell scripting and common command-line utilities.
*   **Begin Your SRE Journey:**
    *   **Read the SRE "Bible":** "Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems."
    *   **Hands-on Monitoring:** Learn to use Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for creating dashboards.
    *   **CI/CD:** Move from theory to practice. Set up a CI/CD pipeline for your project using a tool like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins.

**Year 2: Dive into Distributed Systems and Automation**

*   **Operate Your Application:** Now that you can build an application, focus on running it reliably.
*   **Learn Distributed Systems:**
    *   **Read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann.** This is another foundational text.
    *   **Study Consensus Algorithms:** Understand the theory behind Raft and Paxos.
*   **Deepen Your Container Knowledge:**
    *   **Master Docker:** Go beyond the basics to learn about multi-stage builds, advanced networking, and security best practices.
    *   **Learn Kubernetes:** This is the industry standard for container orchestration. Start by deploying your application on a Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Learn to automate your infrastructure with tools like Terraform or Ansible.

**Year 3: Specialize and Gain Production Experience**

*   **Choose a Specialization:** SRE is a broad field. You might specialize in networking, security, database reliability, or performance engineering.
*   **Get Production Experience:** This is essential. Seek an internship or a full-time role as a backend developer or SRE.
*   **Contribute to Open Source:** This is a fantastic way to learn from experienced engineers and build your professional portfolio.
*   **Never Stop Learning:** The world of SRE is constantly evolving. Stay current with new technologies and best practices.
